# Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming
 - Writing code is a lot like putting a puzzle together, if you don't know the overall picture, each piece will be almost impossible to comprehend.
 - Understanding the problem domain or the the problem you are trying to solve is the most critical piece of the equation in solving it.
 - if you problem domain is unclear you can make it easier by limiting the scope.
 - it is easy to assume you know the problem and just start trying to solve the problem.

## Document Object Model (Chapter 5, pages 183-242)
 - __DOM__ is Document Object Model and it specifies how browsers create HTML and use JS.
 - __API__ Application Programming Interface lets programs and scripts talk to each other.
 - __Nodes__ as a browser loads a web page, it creates a mode of that web page. this model is called a DOM tree and it is stored in the browsers memory and has 4 types of nodes: __Document Node__, __Element Nodes__, __Attribute Nodes__, and __Text Nodes__.
 -__DOM Queries__ methods that find elements in the DOM tree. When you need to work with an element more than once, you should use a variable to store the result of the query.
