John Duckett - JS and jQuery

JQuery (pages 293-301)
* jQuery can select elements, perform tasks and handle events
1. jQuery creates an object by selecting a css element
1. then you will do something to that element by creating a method

(pages 306-331)
* when you select elements, a jQuery object is returned
* .ready() method check that the page is ready for your code to work
* .html() gives every element in the matched set the same new content
* .text() gives every element in the matched set the same new text content
* .replaceWith() replaces every element in a matched set with new content
* .remove() method removes all of the elements in the matched set.
* .before() inserts content before the selected elements
* .after() inserts content after the selected elements
* .prepend() method inserts content inside the selected elements
* .append() inserts content inside the selected item at the end
* .attr() can get or set a specified attribute and its value
* .addClass() adds a new value to the existing value of the class attribute
* .each() is similar to a for loop
* .on() is used to handle all events


(pages 332-335)

6 Reasons for Pair Programming
* 2 heads are better than 1
* 2 people can provide instantaneous bug checking and re-alignment in the path you are taking
* Reading other peoples code, explaining how the code is supposed to work, listening to others and seeing how others write code are all benefits of pair programming you won't get working alone.
1. Greater Efficiency: it has been proven that although the code may take longer to initial create, there are less bugs and the code is better written that reduces de-bugging, overall making the code faster and better with two people's input.
1. Engaged Collaboration: partners hold each other accountable and the amount of time stuck on a problem will be reduced given two people are able to work on the problem with different p.o.v.
1. Learning from Fellow Students: learn how different people think to specific code or shorthand. Explaining to others also helps your comprehension of the topic.
1. Social Skills: communication with different people is vital to working in a company
1. Job Interview Readiness: collaboration with others is frequently as important or more important than your actual coding skills
1. Work Environment Readiness: experience gained at codefellows on how to pair program is an advantage to those with degrees that don't have as much or any experience pair programming.
