### Form Data
 - An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.
 - The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.
 - The method attribute defines how data is sent. HTML form data is most commonly being set by the GET method and the POST method
 - The action value should be a file on the server that can handle the incoming data. this can be typed in the url to manually connect
 - Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs.
