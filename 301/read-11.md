### EJS
 - EJS: EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language which is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript to HTML pages. To begin with, using EJS as templating engine we need to install EJS using given command:
 - index.ejs instead of index.html
 - layout.ejs file: layout will apply the same code to multiple pages, good for nav bars or other elements you want consistently across each file without have to duplicate code.
 - Partials is similar to layouts, but used for text that you want used over all files
 - <%= %> evaluating an injected variable, insert the variable inside and the result will be the corresponding value.
 - <% %> opening and closing ejs tags
